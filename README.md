# Y-TREES
DSA II MINI PROJECT!<br><br>
This project is an implementation of IEEE research paper which allows Better organization of larged size data.<br>
<ul>
  <li>It has a center-based data model which tells us shortest path possible to a node from root.</li>
  <li>The search operations give better results as compared to famous algorithms such as Bellman Ford Algorithm [O(|V|*|E|)] or Dijkstra Method[O(V2)]</li>
</ul>
